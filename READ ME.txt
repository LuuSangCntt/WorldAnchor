How to use it?

Step 1:
Create an empty Object, rename it and add WorldAnchorManager.cs

Step 2:
Add AnchorController to the Object you want to add WorldAnchor, 
Assign the WorldAnchorManager in Step on to it.
Give the Anchor an Id in AnchorId

Step 3:
Create two buttons to call the functions "AnchorController.EnableEditMode" and "AnchorController.DisableEditModeAndSave"

Or you can also call the functions in events of "ManipulationHandler.cs"

Step 4:
Build and Test your app.

Note: It doesn't work in the EditMode of Unity. You need to build the project and run in Hololens 2 device
